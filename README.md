# Survival Analysis of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma with mRNA Sequencing and Machine Learning
This repo contains the code from my final project submission for PATH828 at Queen's University.

## Abstract
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is difficult to diagnose and has increasing levels of prevalence and mortality. Identifying genes with differential expression could be beneficial for prognosis prediction. mRNA Sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Program were run through feature selection, unsupervised and supervised learning methods, as well as statistical analysis, to investigate possible predictive features. A model built using five features chosen by sequential feature selection achieved a prediction accuracy of 76.9 percent. None of these features showed a significant difference in survival prediction based on expression levels. One feature was shown to be significantly differentially expressed in men.

`CholangioScript_v1.m` is the main implementation file. Remaining functions and those found in Preprocessing are helper functions.
