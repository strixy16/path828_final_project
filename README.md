# Survival Analysis of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma with mRNA Sequencing and Machine Learning
This repo contains the code from my final project submission for PATH828 at Queen's University.

Project report can be found under `ProjectReport_Katy_Scott.pdf`

`CholangioScript_v1.m` is the main file. Remaining functions and those found in Preprocessing are helper functions.
